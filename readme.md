# The mango market

The Mango market stalls are regularly running mango specials. Help your friend Vusi to purchase mangos  on special for his fruit and veg shop. With the factory function in `mango-shopper.js` create a web application that will help Vusi to see which mangos are on special.

Use the sql script in `sql/tables.sql` to create the required tables in your local database.

Check out `test/mango-shopper.test.js` to see how to use the supplied Factory Function.

## Factory Function & Queries

For the backend functionality, the queries in mango-shopper.js should be implemented to support the frontend features. Each function in mango-shopper.js should have corresponding SQL queries for database interactions.

##  Create these screens:

* Create a screen where new mango deals can be added: A deal has a price and qty. It's created at a given shop. Shops should be selected from a dropdown. Qty and price should not be blank. And a shop must be selected before a deal is added.

* Create a screen that shows a list of all the shops. Use the pre-populated shops in the `data.sql` file.

* Create a screen that shows all the mango deals for a given shop - link to this screen from the shop list screen above. Show deals in the format `qty for price`. For example `3 for R18`, `5 for R27`

* Create a screen where a new shop can be added. Add a link to this screen from the Shop list screen.

* Show a list of the top 5 mango deals - this should be your landing page. Use deal format. Add some mango pictures or ways to show deal details visually.

* Allow a user to enter how much money they have to get a recommendation of where to go and buy their mangos. Show the deals, the shop name, and the `unit_price` for each deal.
